# Fullstack Next.js

This project has been created to show how to build full-stack apps using Next.js, GraphQL, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The goal is to tie together a number of libraries and services in the context of serverless deployment provided by Next.js.

We'll be using the following libraries and services:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [apollo-server-micro](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/main/packages/apollo-server-micro)
- [graphql-request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request)
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)

The project consists of a number of tutorials.
The focus will be on the backend, however some frontend techniques will also be discussed. In addition,
there will be a basic introduction to SQL and more specifically [PostgreSQL](/sql/intro), as well as a basic introduction to [GraphQL](/graphql).
