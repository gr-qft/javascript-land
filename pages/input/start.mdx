# Getting Started

In this tutorial we will be building an input component. The users will
be able to input a word into an input field, upon which a list of words
will be shown to them.

We'll start with the backend and add the frontend after. To begin, set up a Next.js project:

```
npx create-next-app
```

We'll call the app `input-component`. The default port is `3000`, but if we
want to change it, open `package.json` and add change `scripts` to for example

```json highlight=2,4
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 3300",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start -p 3300"
}
```

Another useful but optional feature is [absolute import](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases). If we want to enable it, create
`jsconfig.json` and add for example the following content

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/components/*": ["components/*"],
      "@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
      "@/lib/*": ["lib/*"]
    }
  }
}
```
