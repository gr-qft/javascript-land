# The Backend

In this section we'll set up the backend using Heroku Postgres, Prisma, and GraphQL. Specifically, we'll set up a GraphQL server that will serve
queries using data from a PostgresSQL database provided by Heroku Postgres.
Prisma functions as an ORM sitting between the database and the server.

## Heroku Postgres

Start by creating a Heroku account. Then create a new app, choose **Resources**, search for **Heroku Postgres**, and add it. Then click
on the newly created resource and choose **Settings**. The option
**Database Credentials** (specifically **URI** inside it) is what we'll need.

## Prisma

Next, we'll add Prisma:

```
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

Then start it by typing

```
npx prisma init
```

which will create two new files, `prisma/schema.prisma` and `.env`. Inside the latter we'll replace the value of `DATABASE_URL`
with the value of `URI` provided by **Database Credentials** from Heroku.

Then, fill `prisma/schema.prisma` with the following content:

```js highlight=10,11,12,13
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Word {
  id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  content   String
}
```

Then, type the following to create tables in the database:

```
npx prisma db push --preview-feature
```

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout>
  You might not need `--preview-feature` and only need `npx prisma db push`
  instead. Check your version of **prisma**. In any case, having
  `--preview-feature` will still work.
</Callout>

To inspect the database, type

```
npx prisma studio
```

and open port `5555`.

We will populate the database with a
list of words from [here](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/words/common.json), with the help of the Prisma client. To start, add the client by typing

```
npm install @prisma/client
```

Then, save the list of words to the folder `prisma`. Then, create `prisma/seed.js`:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')
const words = require('./common.json').commonWords

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  for (let word of words) {
    await prisma.word.create({
      data: {
        content: word,
      },
    })
  }
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    console.log(e)
    process.exit(1)
  })
  .finally(() => {
    prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

and run

```
npx prisma db seed --preview-feature
```

Then, if we visit port `5555` again, we should see that the database
has been seeded.

<Callout>
  Read more about
  [seeding](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/seed-database) and Prisma
  [CRUD](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud#create).
</Callout>

We have used the client to seed the database. Note that if we want the Prisma schema to take effect, we need to run

```
npx prisma generate
```

which indeed needs to be run every time the schema changes. So, run this, and make the client available in the app by creating `lib/prisma.js`:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

let prisma

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  prisma = new PrismaClient()
} else {
  if (!global.prisma) {
    global.prisma = new PrismaClient()
  }
  prisma = global.prisma
}

export default prisma
```

To test that the client is working properly, replace the content of `index.js` with

```js
import styles from '@/styles/Home.module.css'
import prisma from '@/lib/prisma'

export default function Home({ words }) {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      {words.map((word) => (
        <div key={word.id}> {word.content} </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const words = await prisma.word.findMany()

  return {
    props: { words },
  }
}
```

## GraphQL

Next, we'll add a GraphQL server and complete the backend part of the application. The following packages are needed:

```js
npm install apollo-server-micro graphql
```

We can now set up a GraphQL server, taking advantage of Next.js route api. So, create `pages/api/graphql.js` with the following content:

```js
import { ApolloServer, gql } from 'apollo-server-micro'
import prisma from '@/lib/prisma'

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    words(part: String!): [Word!]!
  }

  type Word {
    id: Int!
    content: String!
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    async words(_, args, context) {
      const { part } = args
      const { prisma } = context
      const words = await prisma.word.findMany({
        where: {
          content: {
            contains: part,
          },
        },
      })
      return words
    },
  },
}

const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: () => {
    return { prisma }
  },
})

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
}

export default apolloServer.createHandler({ path: '/api/graphql' })
```

<Callout>
  Note that we've made `prisma` available in the context object so that it will
  be available in the resolvers, in case we want to split `typeDefs` and
  `resolvers` into different files.
</Callout>

We can now visit

```
http://localhost:3300/api/graphql
```

(or whatever port on which Next.js is running) and execute queries, for example

<br />

import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/shots/graphql_playground.png"
  alt="GraphQL Playground"
  width={1536 / 2}
  height={768 / 2}
  layout="intrinsic"
/>

or

```json
query {
  words(part: "lon") {
    id
    content
  }
}
```

the result of which will be

```json
{
  "data": {
    "words": [
      {
        "id": 30,
        "content": "along"
      },
      {
        "id": 487,
        "content": "london"
      },
      {
        "id": 488,
        "content": "long"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This completes the backend part of the application. In the next section, we'll start building the frontend.
